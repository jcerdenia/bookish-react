# bookish-react

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Coding along to _Test Driven Development with React_ from Apress with my own touch. Unfortunately (as is usually the case with programming books, in my experience) the code in the book is riddled with innacuracies that made it difficult to follow. However I still found it to be a good taste of test-driven development: particularly, end-to-end testing with Cypress and unit testing with Jest.

JSON server and Axios were also nice touches, as was the introduction to Redux.
